### My Coding Passion 

I have had the passion of coding since 2023, since then I joined my school tech club, became a very basic game dev there and learnt a lil C#. Well yeah I used Unity and I kinda love Unity till this day!

In the late 2024 I found about [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)'s program [High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com/)! I then made [my very own Github account](https://github.com/404Navdeep) and started coding open source projects!

Till this day I make open source projects, and I love doing so. Coding has evolved from being a hobby to my passion. 

I am also thankfull to Hack Club for helping me in evolving my hobby! 

### My Life Off-Screen

I kinda love playing all kinds of sports and also hanging out with friends, but i guess football takes the 1st place. 

My friends also like doing buisness and we have done some before(ahh that was my best time), right now studies just dont make that possible, maybe dinge.live could change that.
